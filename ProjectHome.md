This project is a sample Python script that will load a set of contacts into the shared contact list of a Google Apps domain using the Shared Contacts and Profiles APIs.

**IMPORTANT:** The Domain Shared Contacts API is only available to Google Apps Premier and Education Editions domains. Please note that Shared contacts are only visible in two places after **24 hours** of their creation, in the domain Contact Manager when you **search** for a Shared Contact and in the Gmail compose emails fields by auto complete.

The script supports:
  * importing a CSV file into the shared contact list of a domain to add, update, delete shared contacts
  * exporting the shared contact list of a domain to a CSV file
  * deleting all shared contacts of a domain
